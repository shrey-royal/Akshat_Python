Difference between OOPs and POPs

OOPs -> Object Oriented Programming System
    > Object Oriented Programming System is a programming system that is based on the concept of objects. 
    > Memory is allocated to the objects and the objects are used to access the memory.
    > The objects are created using the classes.

POPs -> Procedural Oriented Programming System
    > Procedural Oriented Programming System is a programming system that is based on the concept of procedures.
    > Memory is allocated to the procedures and the procedures are used to access the memory.
    > The procedures are created using the functions.

OOPS -> Object Oriented Programming System

0. Classes & Objects
OOPs is divided into 4 parts:
1. Inheritance -> Inheritance is a process in which one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another. With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.

2. Polymorphism -> Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.

3. Abstraction -> Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

4. Encapsulation -> Encapsulation is the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates.
