Task 1:

Create a registration form for a website that requires users to provide their personal information. The form should include fields for the user's name, email address, password, phone number, address, date of birth, gender, and interests. Additionally, the form should allow the user to provide feedback about the website, their current job, education level, annual income, and how they heard about the website. The form should also include a submit button.


Task 2:

Problem Statement:

Starbucks, a popular coffeehouse chain, is looking to create an online ordering system that allows customers to customize their orders based on their preferences. The system should allow customers to select multiple options such as coffee type, size, milk preference, sweetener preference, and other related data entered by the user. Additionally, the system should allow customers to enter any additional instructions or requests for their order.

Scenario:

You are tasked with creating an online ordering form for Starbucks that allows customers to customize their coffee orders. The form should be easy to use and intuitive, allowing customers to quickly select their preferred options and enter any additional instructions.

To begin, you should create a new HTML file and use the <form> tag to define the ordering form. Within the form, you should include fields for the customer's name, email address, phone number, and preferred pickup location. You should also include fields for the coffee order, such as coffee type, size, milk preference, sweetener preference, and any additional options or ingredients that the customer may want to add.

To ensure that the form is easy to use, you should use the appropriate HTML input types and attributes for each field. For example, you could use radio buttons or dropdown menus for selecting coffee type, size, and milk preference. You could also use checkboxes for selecting sweetener preference and additional options or ingredients.

Finally, you should include a text area field for customers to enter any additional instructions or requests for their order. This will allow customers to provide more specific instructions, such as "extra foam" or "extra shot of espresso".

Once the form has been created, you should test it thoroughly to ensure that all fields are working as expected. You may want to test the form with a variety of different inputs to make sure that it is able to handle all possible scenarios.

Overall, by creating a user-friendly ordering form, you can help Starbucks provide a more personalized and convenient ordering experience for their customers.
